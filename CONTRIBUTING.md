# Contributing

We're glad that you're interested in making `cargo-ghp-upload` better!
That can take the form of just reporting bugs or sending PRs with changes.
We appreciate both, and will see to it that your contribution is seen & acted upon.

## PR workflow

All additions to the code go through GitHub PRs.
By using [Bors](https://bors.tech/), we know that none of them will break our build.
See [the Bors docs](https://bors.tech/documentation/getting-started/) for more about how to use Bors.

## Behavior

We have an official [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), but it boils down to: Be Nice.
Be courtious to others' thought process, which is different from yours.
Everyone has their own priorities and opinions.
